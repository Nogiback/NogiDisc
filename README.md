# NogiDisc

A disc golf inventory app for disc golf enthusiasts.

NogiDisc is a React web application created for disc golf enthusiasts in mind. As an avid disc golfer, I found myself with a mountain of discs I've collected over the years with no real way of keeping track of them all. So, I decided to build my own inventory management application. NogiDisc allows users to create an account and start importing their discs while also grouping them together via the bag system. Happy hucking!
